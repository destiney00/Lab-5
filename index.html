        My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I
        found out he was going to die. That it was going to happen
        soon. That it was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff.
        Things I hadn't thought about for a long time. I guess I kind
        of took him for granted or something. I mean, our parents are
        just always there. You expect them to always be bugging you
        to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or
        try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one
        day. And make you get up early on the weekend to have
        "family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me
        crazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different since
        Dad got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in the
        near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.

        Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that
        question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being responsible.
        One day he won't be here to ask. Now I feel lucky when I hear
        his car pulled into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him coughing.
        It means he's still around. Still my dad.

        My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.
        I mean, super brainiac annoying. He knows the most random stuff. Like
        how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.
        And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it
        takes up about 9% more space. Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt
        into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level
        will go down. He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He
        doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.
        I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is. He likes to cook
        because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemical reactions happen all the time in
        cooking and he's always explaining as he
        goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.
        He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.

    <p> What a wonderful dad I have, <br> But he is in trouble. </p>

    <p> It's Lung Cancer. <br> He needs an operation. Now! </p>

    <p> To help, please send your contribution <br>
        to our operation fund <br>
        and keep my Dad in your prayers!
